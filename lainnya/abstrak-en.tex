\textbf{Abstract}

% Isi Abstrak
The Metaverse is a set of virtual spaces, where one can create
and browse with other internet users who are not in the same physical space
with that person. The application often uses blockchain as a solution
decentralized. The Metaverse itself certainly requires an audio output, which is realized
by Unreal Engine 5 with its metasound feature.

Merging the two can be achieved by using smart contracts. Then in
This research will create a system that can make this happen with the help of Ethereum
Smart Contract, NFT to store metadata, and IPFS web3.storage to store
audio source files for metasound.

With the existence of a decentralized system, it is also hoped that interoperability will be realized.
ability to make this metaverse usable and communicate with other blockchain platforms.
